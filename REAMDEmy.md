## user.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress为什么是这样获取邮箱，users表中是email字段啊，不是应该user.email吗

You're noticing an important distinction between two different user objects in your code:
user (from useUser() hook) - This is Clerk's authentication user object
data.user (from your API response) - This is your database user object
When accessing user.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress, you're working with Clerk's user model, not your database model. Clerk structures their user object with support for multiple email addresses, so the email is accessed through this nested property path.
Your database users table indeed has a simple email field, which is accessible as data.user.email from the API response.
