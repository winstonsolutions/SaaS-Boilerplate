    "question1": "What is Pixel Capture and how does it work?",
    "answer1": "Pixel Capture is a browser extension that allows you to take precise screenshots with custom dimensions. It works by overlaying a measurement tool on your screen, letting you select exact areas to capture, and then providing various export options including PNG, JPG, WebP, and PDF formats.",
    "question2": "What makes Pixel Capture different from regular screenshot tools?",
    "answer2": "Unlike standard screenshot tools, Pixel Capture offers pixel-perfect precision with customizable dimensions, making it ideal for designers and developers who need exact measurements. It also provides cloud storage, multi-device synchronization, and supports multiple export formats including PDF.",
    "question3": "Do I need to create an account to use Pixel Capture?",
    "answer3": "The basic features of Pixel Capture can be used without an account. However, to access cloud storage, synchronization across devices, and PDF export capabilities, you'll need to create an account and subscribe to our Pro plan.",
    "question4": "Can I use Pixel Capture on multiple browsers?",
    "answer4": "Currently, Pixel Capture is available as a Chrome extension. We're working on supporting other browsers like Firefox, Safari, and Edge in future updates. With a Pro account, you can sync your screenshots across different devices using the same browser.",
    "question5": "What's the difference between the Free and Pro plans?",
    "answer5": "The Free plan gives you access to basic screenshot functionality with PNG, JPG, and WebP formats, along with 2GB of storage. The Pro plan ($1.99/month) adds PDF export capability, increases storage to 10GB, and provides priority email support.",
    "question6": "How secure are my screenshots in the cloud?",
    "answer6": "We take security seriously. All screenshots stored in our cloud are encrypted both in transit and at rest. We use industry-standard security practices, and your data is never shared with third parties without your explicit permission."
